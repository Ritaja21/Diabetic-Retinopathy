# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

Welcome to the **Diabetic Retinopathy Detection** project! This project leverages AI and deep learning techniques to detect diabetic retinopathy from retinal images, aiding early diagnosis and better healthcare interventions.

## 🚀 Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes advanced neural networks for accurate classification.
- **Automated Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for downsampling, dataset splitting, and preprocessing ensure optimal model training.
- **TFRecords Support**: Efficiently handles large-scale datasets.
- **Web Integration**: User-friendly interface with **React.js** frontend for easy accessibility.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `Downsample.py` – Reduces image size for optimized training.
- `MA.py` – Data preprocessing and training scripts.
- `SplitDataset.py` – Organizes dataset into train, validation, and test sets.
- `TFRecords.py` – Processes datasets into TFRecords format for better performance.
- `index.html`, `index.css`, `main.jsx` – Frontend web interface.
- `main.py` – Main script to run the project.
